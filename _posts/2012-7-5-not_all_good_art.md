title: Not All Good Art Comes From Suffering
category: startups
---

A mantra from one of my favorite Punk Bands. San Francisco's own Dead To Me. I have yet to write about the overlap of Punk and entrepreneurial ethos I'll save that for another post.
With this post I would like to address the misplaced suffering which is often mistaken for 'entrepreneurial spirit'

I've spent my fair share of time on the Silicon Valley Startup Scene. I've crashed with 5 people in a two bedroom apartment sleeping on a kitchen floor. I've burned the midnight oil pushing code late into the night.
