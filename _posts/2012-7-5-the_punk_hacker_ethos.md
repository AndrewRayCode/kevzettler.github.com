In a former life [I was lead singer](http://www.offendyourfriends.com/media) of a marginally successful semi-regional punk rock band.
This was a period of positive growth for me and I learned many valuable life lessons and a surprising amount of business skills.
As I grew into the role of hacker and entrepreneur I found myself ahead of many first time entrepreneurial peers. 
Many of the core values that I had adopted from the Punk community were shared and praised by the Startup community as well. 

## DIY
Do it yourself. A core value of Punk culture. Make your own clothes. Paint your own art. Start your own record label. Book your own gigs. Fix your own car.
Punk Bands build their own brands.
