Spurred by Louis C.K's bit on why he won't buy his children cell phones. I thought I would share my experiences with what I've been calling, "Digital Depression" quite possibly a modern psychological syndrome.

This post isn't to blame the technology itself for the depression. I'm not saying "Stop producing cellphones because they cause emotional damage" I'm trying to acknowledge that it is a possible catalyst and enabler of depression.

Growing up has been hard for me. I've spent some time in therapy. During my childhood I had no positive role models. My girlfriend jokes that I'm like a feral child that was raised by wolves in rural Wisconsin. I was never taught or shown how to acknowledge my emotions, to communicate how I felt in situations, or make decisions based on them.

My parents were addicted to TV. I inherited their digital depression habits. My family rarely shared opinions, or feelings on things. If a discussion did arise it was at a superficial level "Im angry at other football team because they're not my football team." These expressions were acceptable.

When emotions were brought up at more sensitive topics. "I"m angry because I'm having a hard time at school". "I'm sad because my friend moved away". Our family message was "you're in a bad mood, get over it". Get over it, implied go do something else to not think about how you're feeling.

These kind of family values, reinforced the use of entertainment technology as digital depressant. I was using video game consoles as my depressant, as a child. later a PC in my teenage years.

In my adulthood I've had major challenges making friends and connecting with people. I've not opened up and communicated my feelings with people simple because I didn't know how. People would ask "how do you feel about: x" and most always my internal thought would be "I don't care about x. I don't care about y. fuck the world."

I've struggled in my adult life with becoming a full blown digital recluse.

My relationships were all superficial. People would label

I've struggled in my adult life with becoming a full blown digital recluse.

Until recently I would say that I have been totally out of touch with my emotions or feelings anytime I feel the slightest of emotional inklings I jump into distraction. Check email on the cellphone, turn on the TV, listen to some music.

Totally out of touch socially and emotionally. Living out modeled through scenes on the Simpson. I thought the library was something only poor people and nerds went to. My father was a 'quite' guy. 


Cell phone kids these days have it just as bad. Can't even communicate with eachother outside of txt messages. 

when I start to focus on a theme I get hit with writers block. Now i'm feeling kinda sleepy/.
