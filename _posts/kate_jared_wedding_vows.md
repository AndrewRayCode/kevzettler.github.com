### Kate & Jared Wedding Ceremony

## Introduction

Friends & Family. Today is a celebration. A celebration of love, of commitment, of friendship, of family, and of two people who are in it for forever. Today, we celebrate Kate and Jared. 

Wedding ceremonies are kind of weird, right? You have two good looking people on a stage, being admired by everyone they've met in the past 20 years. So why do people do it? The marriage ceremony has been an important feature across nearly every culture, religion, generation, and society. We have thousands of important moments that happen throughout our lives, but this is regarded as one so critical, we acknowledge its special status by sharing it with others. Why is this so imporant?

Because no matter how differnt we all are. Love is the great unifier. No matter who we are, where we've come from, what we believe, we know. love is what we're doing right. That's why *these two* are standing here. That's why *everyone else* is here to watch them. We've all loved in our lifetimes, and in this moment, we're reminded that the ability to love is the very best part of humanity.

Everyone has their own experience and definition of love. Love to me is a powerful force that I heard about in Motown songs growing up. Its a chorus to Beatles songs. Everyone here has crazy personal love stories. I've shared most of them since i've been in town. Some are short, some are long. Some have just begun. There are ups and downs in all our stories, and to quote Joe Stummer, "The future is unwritten".

Over the last 7 years, I’ve watched Kate & Jared’s story develop. During that time I could felt they were very special to each other. Kate and Jared are a unique couple. Jared isn't known as MellowJ just because it sounds cool. Nothing phases him and he is always there to anchor Kate. When Kate gets overwhelmed or stressed out, Jared is there to keep things cool. Kate is relentlessly resourceful, supportive and encouraging. She pushes Jared to try, grow and learn. They both do that for each other. They are both talented artists in their own mediums and when they come together on projects, real magic happens. That is really straight up value added to the whole world.

People say true love is supposed to be unconditional. As a programmer I cant really relate to that. My brain is constantly thinking if-this-do-that. I don't really think unconditionally. But when I see Kate and Jared interact together, I know the unconditional part is true. I've seen them in some annoying and frustrating situations and they've consistently treated each other well. Kate's straight up told me no matter what happens, she just always loves Jared. That's real talk.

And that brings them here. Let's pause, look back, and smile at all the moments that brought them here. And look ahead at all the moments that are still to come.

Kate and Jare. I'm here — we're all here — because we want those moments for you. We're here to hope with you, to support you, to be proud of you, and to remind you that love isn't happily ever after, love is the experience of writing your story. It's not one moment — not even this moment. It's every moment. Big ones like saying "I love you," moving in together, getting engaged — but mostly a million little ones that come in between the big moments. Falling asleep next to one another, making dinner together, going to punk rock shows together, spending holidays with your families, getting a big hug when you get home from work. These everyday moments fuse together into one big experience.

And even though this experience is so incredible, words fail us when we try and explain it. That's just the way it is with love — it's meant to be felt, not described.

But trying to describe love is one of our favorite pastimes. We use the words we have to write stories, and poems, and songs about love. And even though we describe love in different ways — and even though love can look different from one person to the next — we all know it when we see it. And we see it here.


## Vows
OFFICIANT: Kate & Jared, you fell in love by chance, but you're here today because you're making a choice. You both are choosing each other. You've chosen to be with someone who enhances you, who makes you think, makes you smile, and makes every day brighter.

You're about to make promises to each other that you intend to keep. You're going to vow to take care of each other, to stand up for one another, and find happiness in the other. There's a simple premise to each of these promises: you're vowing to be there. You're teaming up and saying to the other, "Every experience I am going to have, I want you to be a part of."

Will you, Jared, keep Kate as your favorite person — to laugh with her, go on adventures with her, support her through life's tough moments, be proud of her, grow old with her, and find new reasons to love her every day?

JARED: I will. 

Will you, Kate, keep Jared as your favorite person — to laugh with him, go on adventures with him, support him through life's tough moments, be proud of him, grow old with him, and find new reasons to love him every day?

KATE: I will.

OFFICIANT: Will you, Jared & Kate, be each other's partners from this day forward? Will you bring out the best in one another, share your happiest moments together, and love each other absolutely — for the rest of this lifetime and for whatever may come next?

JARED & KATE: We will.


## Ring exchange

OFFICIANT: You've both chosen to wear rings as a reminder of these promises. 

I ask Ben to give Kate's ring to Jared. 
(Pause until Ben has given Jared the ring and is back in his spot)
Jared, place the ring on Kate's finger and repeat after me....
I give you this ring.
Wear it with love and joy. 
(Pause - wait for Jared to repeat the first 2 lines)
As this ring has no end,
My love is also forever.
(Pause - wait for Jared to repeat the last 2 lines)

Ben, now please give Jared's ring to Kate.
(Pause until Ben has given Kate the ring and is back in his spot)
Kate, place the ring on Jared's finger and repeat after me....
With this ring,
I marry you.
(Pause - wait for Kate to repeat the first 2 lines)
Wear this ring forever
As a sign of my love.
(Pause - wait for Kate to repeat the last 2 lines)

May the wedding rings you exchanged today remind you always that you are surrounded by enduring love.
