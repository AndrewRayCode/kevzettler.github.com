### Kate Jared Wedding Ceremony

## Introduction

Dearly beloved, Friends and family. We are gathered here today to observer and participate in the ageless tradition of marriage. We're here to witness and support Kate and Jared. Today is a ceremony to celebrate a union of two individuals. A union that will enhance the lives of them as individuals and the world around them as a couple.

We all have our own experiences and definitions of love. Love to me is a powerful force that I heard about in Motown songs growing up. Its a chemical reaction composed of several different neurotransmitters, OxyTocin and Vasopressin drive feelings of Attachment. Dopamine and Serotonin drive feelings of Attraction. I'm probably the worst person to be leading this ceremony. I"m borderline Aspergers and don't know if I can relate to feelings of love.

People say true Love is supposed to be unconditional. As a programmer I cant really relate to that. My brain is constantly thinking if-this-do-that. I don't really think unconditionally. When I see Kate and Jared interact together. I know the unconditional part is true. I've seen them in some annoying and frustraing situations and they've consitently treated each other well. Kates straight up told me no matter what happens she just always loves Jared. Thats real talk

An observation on their pair dynamic. Jared isn't known as Mellow J because it sounds cool. Nothing phases him and hes an anchor for Kate. Kate is relentsly resourceful supportive and encourgning. They are both brilliantly talented artests in their own mediums and when they come together on projects real magic happens.


## Vows
OFFICIANT: You fell in love by chance, but you're here today because you're making a choice. You both are choosing each other. You've chosen to be with someone who enhances you, who makes you think, makes you smile, and makes every day brighter.
You're about to make promises to each other that you intend to keep. You're going to vow to take care of each other, to stand up for one another, and find happiness in the other. There's a simple premise to each of these promises: you're vowing to be there. You're teaming up and saying to the other, "Every experience I am going to have, I want you to be a part of."

Will you, Jared, keep Kate as your favorite person — to laugh with her, go on adventures with her, support her through life's tough moments, be proud of her, grow old with her, and find new reasons to love her every day?
JARED: I will. 

Will you, Kate, keep Jared as your favorite person — to laugh with him, go on adventures with him, support him through life's tough moments, be proud of him, grow old with him, and find new reasons to love her every day?
KATE: I will.

OFFICIANT: Will you, Jared & Kate, be each other's partners from this day forward? Will you bring out the best in one another, share your happiest moments together, and love each other absolutely — for the rest of this lifetime and for whatever may come next?
JARED & KATE: We will.


## Ring exchange

OFFICIANT: You’ve both chosen to wear rings as a reminder of these promises. People often say wedding bands are a perfect circle, with no beginning and no end. 

I ask Ben to give Kate’s ring to Jared.
Jared, place the ring on Kate’s finger and repeat after me....
I give you this ring.
Wear it with love and joy. 
As this ring has no end,
My love is also forever.

Ben, now please give Jared’s ring to Kate.
Kate, place the ring on Jared’s finger and repeat after me....
With this ring,
I marry you.
Wear this ring forever
As a sign of my love.

May the wedding rings you exchanged today remind you always that you are surrounded by enduring love.

## Final toast

Now by the power vested in me by the City of Fond du Lac and the Internet.. , it is my honor and delight to declare you husband and wife. You may now kiss your bride.

I am pleased to present the newlyweds, Mr. and Mrs. Jared Powell!

Now the real celebration begins.
